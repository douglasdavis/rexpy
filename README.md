Some tools to guide TRExFitter with a real programming language
(Python).

Setup
-----

Working in an ATLAS environment is not very vanilla, so we can't just
install this with pip and move on with our lives. the `rx-init.sh`
script tries to make this a little easier, CVMFS installed with the
standard LHC Computing Grid repositories are required; just run:

```
$ . rx-init.sh
```
