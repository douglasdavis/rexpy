rexpy
=====

Libraries and scripts to guide TRExFitter with a real programming
language (Python).

Setup
-----

Working in an ATLAS environment is not very vanilla, so we can't just
install this with `pip` and move on with our lives
(unfortunately). The `rp-init.sh` script tries to make this a little
easier, CVMFS installed with the standard LHC Computing Grid
repositories are required; just run:

```
$ . rp-init.sh
```
